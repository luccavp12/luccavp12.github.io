        <p class="projectDescription">
            This is a project I build over the summer to try and solve an issue I had with communicating with others
            during quaranteen online.
            <br> <br>
            The basic premise is that I was constantly switching between the applications Discord and Slack. 
            <br>
            Doing this was extremely time consuming, and would make me lose focus on what I was working on.
            <br> <br>
            Both of these platforms are very useful, however they each have the potential to have multiple <br>
            communities within them. And of course each of these communities have a large amount of members, text channels <br>
            group chats, and direct messages. It was getting a little out of hand.
            <br> <br>
            So I tried to find a way to make the interaction between the two more efficient!
            <br> <br>
            Image of the main page of ChatVac:

        <p class="projectDescription">
            This is the main screen of ChatVac, where you will be interacting with all of your messages from your different platforms.
            <br> <br>
            On the left you have the channel lists. With both Slack and Discord, you have servers and channels within each server. 
            <br>
            So every channel you add to ChatVac, will show up here.
            <br> <br>
            At the moment, ChatVac is only build for Slack and Discord, but is fully scalable to use other services.
            <br> <br>
            The channel list has 2 styles of selections, each for Slack and Discord, showcasing the company's color scheme.
            <br>
            When you click on a channel to read or send a chat to, a white border surrounds the channel selected.
            <br> <br>
            ChatVac is built around the developer API tools from both Discord and Slack. 
            <br>
            API requests are being made every time a message is sent to ChatVac, and when you send a message to a channel from ChatVac.
            <br> <br>
            Currently, as of 10/26/20, I am able to use ChatVac for my own account, but I am in the works of getting it available to multiple users.
            <br> <br>
